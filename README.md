Apollo is a set of Java libraries that we use at Spotify when writing microservices. Apollo includes modules such as an HTTP server and a URI routing system, making it trivial to implement restful API services. 

Apollo has been used in production at Spotify for a long time. As a part of the work to release version 1.0.0 we moved the development of Apollo into the open. 

There are three main libraries in Apollo:

* [apollo-http-service](apollo-http-service)
* [apollo-api](apollo-api)
* [apollo-core](apollo-core)

If you need to solve a problem where the main APIs aren't powerful enough, 
[apollo-environment](apollo-environment) provides more hooks, allowing you to modify
the core behaviours of Apollo.

### Apollo HTTP Service
The [apollo-http-service](apollo-http-service) library is a standardized assembly of Apollo
modules. It incorporates both apollo-api and apollo-core and ties them together with other
modules to get a standard api service using http for incoming and outgoing communication.

### Apollo API
The [apollo-api](apollo-api) library is the Apollo library you are most likely to interact with.
It gives you the tools you need to define your service routes and your request/reply handlers.

Here, for example, we define that our service will respond to a GET request on the path `/` with
the string `"hello world"`:
```java
public static void init(Environment environment) {
  environment.routingEngine()
      .registerAutoRoute(Route.sync("GET", "/", requestContext -> "hello world"));
}
```

The apollo-api library provides several ways to help you define your request/reply handlers.
You can specify how responses should be serialized (such as JSON). Read more about
this library in the [Apollo API Readme](apollo-api).

### Apollo Core
The [apollo-core](apollo-core) library manages the lifecycle (loading, starting, and stopping) of
your service. You do not usually need to interact directly with apollo-core; think of it merely 
as "plumbing". For more information about this library, see the [Apollo Core Readme](apollo-core).

### Apollo Test
In addition to the three main Apollo libraries listed above, to help you write tests for your
service we have an additional library called [apollo-test](apollo-test). It has helpers to set up
a service for testing, and to mock outgoing request responses.

### Getting Started with Apollo
Apollo will be distributed as a set of Maven artifacts, which makes it easy to get started no matter the build tool; Maven, Ant + Ivy or Gradle. Below is a very simple but functional service â€” more extensive examples are available in the [examples](examples) directory. Until these are released, you can build and install Apollo from source by running `mvn install`.

```java
public final class App {

    public static void main(String... args) throws LoadingException {
        HttpService.boot(App::init, "my-app", args);
    }

    static void init(Environment environment) {
        environment.routingEngine()
            .registerAutoRoute(Route.sync("GET", "/", rc -> "hello world"));
    }
 }
```

### Apollo Metadata
[Metadata](apollo-api-impl/src/main/java/com/spotify/apollo/meta/model) about an Apollo-based service, such as endpoints, is generated at runtime. At Spotify we use this to keep track of our running services. More info can be found [here](https://apidays.nz/slides/iglesias_service_metadata.pdf).

Examples from [spotify-api-example](examples/spotify-api-example):

`$ curl http://localhost:8080/_meta/0/endpoints`

```json
{
  "result": {
    "docstring": null,
    "endpoints":[
      {
        "docstring": "Get the latest albums on Spotify.\n\nUses the public Spotify API https://api.spotify.com to get 'new' albums.",
        "method": [
          "GET"
        ],
        "methodName": "/albums/new[GET]",
        "queryParameters":[],
        "uri": "/albums/new"
      },
      {
        "docstring": "Responds with a 'pong!' if the service is up.\n\nUseful endpoint for doing health checks.",
        "method": [
          "GET"
        ],
        "methodName": "/ping[GET]",
        "queryParameters": [],
        "uri": "/ping"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

`$ curl http://localhost:8080/_meta/0/info`

```json
{
  "result": {
    "buildVersion": "spotify-api-example-service 1.3.1",
    "componentId": "spotify-api-example-service",
    "containerVersion": "apollo-http2.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "serviceUptime": 778.249,
    "systemVersion": "java 1.8.0_111"
  }
}
```
