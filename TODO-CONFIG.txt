- decide about setting apollo-configuration 'constants' for an application. Lenses?!?
- fix meta tests/implement configuration support in meta + revisit skipped test in ServiceHelper, or wherever
- figure out how to do overrides based on CLI/envvars.
- implement in apollo-standalone, particularly interesting to see how hermes client config will work, with collections
- consider removing the 'run <pod>' command line args - there doesn't seem to be any reason why apollo itself needs args?
- go through all TODO comments in the code
- update README files and other docs
- go through CLI parsing and env overrides in ServiceImpl to see if something needs to be kept.



DONE:
- implement service-specific configuration support
  - use typesafe config!?
  - file name: default based on service name, override? requires standard apollo CLI args/arg
  - what about things like apollo client config? this is service-specific, but reaches into apollo.
    needs thinking about?
  - no overrides? if you have a config file, you might as well override things there; why bother with
    overrides? typesafe cfg does allow it, so maybe that's OK. There's also the consistency argument
  - simply do ConfigFactory.load(): typesafe config already has all the necessary override semantics.
